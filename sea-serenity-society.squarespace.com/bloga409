Red Tide refers to the blooming of Karenia Brevis algae which can mostly be found in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. In small blooms, K. Brevis algae poses little to no threat. However, in large masses, the spores of this algae can lead to high health risks and even death for not only wildlife but humans as well. A study found in the journal of “Harmful Algae” covers the risks and recorded dangers K. Brevis blooms pose.</p><h3><strong>Poisoning</strong></h3><p class="">Red Tide in a mass quantity can release toxins that infect shellfish and a variety of other fish species. Humans who eat these infected fish can experience infection from toxins related to paralytic or neurotic shellfish poisoning. This can lead to victims contracting gastrointestinal Infections to neurological impairment.</p><h3><strong>Respiratory Issues</strong></h3><p class="">Red Tide blooms are also capable of releasing microscopic spores that can travel by coastal wind. Inhalation of these spores has been noted to cause severe coughing, wheezing, irritation of the throat, as well as difficulty breathing. These spores are exceptionally dangerous to anyone with pre existing respiratory illnesses such as asthma. Prolonged exposure to Red Tide spores have led to reports of permanent lung damage and for those with pre existing issues, death.</p><h3><strong>Physical Irritation</strong></h3><p class="">Exposure to Red Tide algae, direct or airborne, have led to victims experiencing physical pain and discomfort. Reports of eye irritation, inflammation of the nasal cavity, extreme rash and a painful burning sensation are results of exposure. Anyone swimming in Infected water or standing near the water line are likely to be heavily affected and are urged to seek immediate medical attention. Over exposure to airborne spores without proper treatment could lead to prolonged health risk such as partial blindness or lung damage.</p><h3><strong>Beyond Physical</strong></h3><p class="">Red Tide not only affects wildlife and human health, but also the economic health of it's location. Red Tide is in a Sense, a disease, therefore it must be treated with the utmost caution. Infected waters can lead to beach closers for prolonged periods of time as well as entire towns shutting down due to air pollution. Tourism is greatly affected by this and certain places that rely on that seasonal income begin to suffer. Most notably in places that see increased population growth during the summer months. Red Tide has led to severe drops in revenue greatly damaging or even killing off entire businesses.</p><h3><strong>How Can You Help?</strong> </h3><p class="">Recognizing Red Tide is the first step in helping to treat it, thanks to a number of active organizations we can keep our coastline healthy and safe for years to come. Below are some sources for more information on Red Tide and how you can help.</p><p class=""><a href="https://mote.org/florida-red-tide-how-you-can-help" target="_blank">MOTE MARINE LABORATORY - Florida Red Tide: How You Can Help</a></p><p class=""><a href="https://www.visitflorida.org/resources/crisis-preparation/red-tide-information/" target="_blank">VISIT FLORIDA - Red Tide Information</a></p><h3><a href="https://www.visitflorida.org/resources/crisis-preparation/red-tide-information/" target="_blank"> </a></h3><h3><strong>Author: Austin Griggs</strong></h3><h4><strong>Works Cited</strong></h4><p class="">Diaz, Roberto Efrain, et al.

While the physical benefits of a healthy ocean—such as clean water, sustainable fisheries, and biodiversity—are often highlighted, its impact on our mental health is just as profound. With growing evidence suggesting that the state of our marine environments directly affects our psychological well-being, it's crucial to understand how an unhealthy ocean can negatively impact our mental health.</p><h3><strong>The Symbiotic Relationship Between Ocean and Human Health</strong></h3><p class="">Oceans cover over 70% of the Earth’s surface, playing a critical role in regulating the planet’s climate and weather systems. They provide oxygen, food, and livelihoods for billions of people. However, their significance extends beyond these tangible benefits. The ocean is a source of psychological relaxation, inspiration, and joy for many. Its aesthetic beauty, sounds, and recreational opportunities contribute significantly to human well-being.</p><h3><strong>The Mental Health Toll of a Degraded Ocean</strong></h3><h4><strong>1. Stress and Anxiety from Environmental Degradation</strong></h4><p class="">When our oceans suffer from pollution, overfishing, and climate change, it leads to a loss of biodiversity and degradation of marine ecosystems. This degradation can contribute to a sense of helplessness and stress among individuals who recognize the importance of the ocean and feel powerless to protect it. According to research published in People and Nature (2019), environmental degradation is directly associated with increased levels of stress and anxiety among coastal communities and individuals who have a strong connection to marine environments .</p><h4><strong>2. Loss of Recreational Spaces</strong></h4><p class="">Healthy oceans offer numerous recreational activities such as swimming, diving, and coastal walking, which are known to improve mood and reduce stress. When ocean health deteriorates, these activities become less accessible or enjoyable due to polluted waters and depleted marine life. This loss can lead to decreased physical activity and a reduction in the psychological benefits associated with time spent in nature.</p><h4><strong>3. Economic Impacts Leading to Psychological Distress</strong></h4><p class="">Coastal and island communities heavily rely on the ocean for their livelihoods. Fisheries, tourism, and other marine-related industries are vital economic drivers. The degradation of marine environments threatens these industries, leading to job losses and economic instability. The resulting financial strain can cause significant mental health issues, including depression and anxiety, as people struggle to cope with the economic downturn.</p><h4><strong>4. Cultural and Spiritual Disconnect</strong></h4><p class="">Many cultures have deep spiritual and cultural connections to the ocean. The degradation of marine ecosystems can erode these connections, leading to a loss of cultural identity and spiritual fulfillment. For indigenous and coastal communities, the ocean is not just a resource but a sacred entity. The psychological impact of losing this connection can be profound, leading to feelings of grief and loss.</p><h3><strong>Moving Forward: Protecting Ocean Health to Safeguard Mental Health</strong></h3><p class="">To address these challenges, it’s imperative to adopt a holistic approach to ocean conservation that includes the consideration of human mental health. Here are some strategies:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Promote Sustainable Practices: Encouraging sustainable fishing, reducing carbon footprint, and supporting marine protected areas can help restore ocean health, thus preserving its psychological benefits.</p></li><li><p class="">Community Engagement and Education: Educating communities about the importance of ocean conservation and involving them in restoration projects can foster a sense of empowerment and reduce feelings of helplessness.</p></li><li><p class="">Mental Health Support for Affected Communities: Providing mental health resources and support to communities directly impacted by ocean degradation can help mitigate the psychological toll.</p></li><li><p class="">Enhancing Access to Nature: Creating and maintaining coastal parks and marine sanctuaries can provide safe, clean spaces for recreation and relaxation, promoting mental well-being.</p></li></ul><h3> <strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p class="">The health of our oceans is not just a matter of environmental urgency but also a critical component of human mental health. As we continue to grapple with the effects of climate change and environmental degradation, it’s essential to recognize and address the mental health implications of an unhealthy ocean. By working towards restoring and preserving our marine environments, we can ensure a healthier, happier future for both the planet and its people.</p><h3><strong>Author: Brooke Moss</strong> </h3><h4><strong>Works Cited</strong></h4><p class="">Fleming LE,  Maycock B,  White MP,  Depledge MH.

Some of the most populated cities are coastal, whether those cities are in the U.S. or abroad. As coastal and global population increases, the connection between ocean health and human well-being becomes increasingly substantial. With the COVID-19 pandemic, society has a better grasp on the sense that there can be adverse health outcomes from our environment, which is no different for coastal communities.</p><h3><strong>How Does The Ocean Impact Us?</strong></h3><p class="">Some coastal inhabitants worldwide have been affected by floods, hurricanes, tsunamis, etc. Many scientists and researchers have stated that climate change will negatively impact many coastal cities with rising global temperatures, contributing to rising sea levels. However, rising sea levels is not the only negative outcome that can affect human health. Our actions of disposing of wastes into bodies of water have had several health implications for humans, including drowning, exposure to harmful algal blooms, chemical pollution, and microbial pollution, which can be further compounded by sea-level rise, ocean warming, acidification, and deoxygenation. (Fleming et al., 2021). Furthermore, more than 250 million clinical cases of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease are linked annually to contaminated seas (Fleming et al., 2021). Individuals and organizations must follow proper waste protocols to reduce harmful environmental and health effects.</p><h3><strong>On The Brighter Side</strong></h3><p class="">Despite its challenges, the ocean offers many benefits to human civilization. In addition to coasts being utilized for global shipping, marine ecosystems provide an essential food source, with millions depending on seafood for their daily protein intake. Furthermore, sources of marine organisms are used in pharmaceuticals and medical treatments, offering potential solutions to various health issues (Fleming et al., 2021). Spending time near the ocean has been exhibited to positively impact mental health and wellness, promote relaxation, reduce stress, stimulate physical activity, and reduce overall obesity.</p><h3><strong>What Can We Do?</strong></h3><p class="">We must adopt sustainable practices to safeguard ocean health and human health. Fleming et al. highlight that on the individual level, some of the actions we can take are to enjoy the coasts safely and sustainably, encourage school projects on ocean literacy, and participate in clean-up activities.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p class="">In conclusion, the relationship between the ocean and human health is complex. While the ocean and marine life provide us with resources and recreational activities, it also poses significant risks to human health, particularly for coastal populations. By dealing with the threats posed by pollution, climate change, and unsustainable practices, we can foster the benefits of the ocean while safeguarding the health and resilience of both marine ecosystems and human societies.</p><h3><strong>Author: Jason Wingfield</strong></h3><h4><strong>Works Cited</strong></h4><p class="">Fleming, Lora E et al. “The Ocean Decade—Opportunities for Oceans and Human Health Programs to Contribute to Public Health.” American journal of public health (1971) 111.5 (2021): 808–811.

microbiomes for their vital functions.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>What Is A Microbiome? </strong></h3><p class="">Microbiome: The most important aspect to the health of any living organism. This word refers to the collection of microorganisms residing in a specific environment.</p><h3><strong>The Human Gut Microbiome</strong></h3><p class="">The gut microbiome, among other human microbiomes, has essential functions in digestion, nutrient absorption, and immune system function. They assist in the digestion of intricate carbohydrates, production of necessary vitamins, and defense against harmful pathogens. “Evidenced by several studies is the influence of environmental microbes upon the human microbiome and ultimately human health. As the living environment dramatically affects the microbiota, a closer living with nature would facilitate the diversification and balance of microbiota inside the body. A multi-disciplinary understanding, joint effort, and thought system can be the possible solution to obtain optimum health for humans, animals, and the environment.” (Panthee et al., 2022). </p><h3><strong>Marine Microbiomes &amp; Human Health</strong></h3><p class="">Marine ecosystems rely on complex communities of microorganisms in ocean microbiomes for their vital functions. The ocean microbiome has the potential to greatly benefit human health. Nevertheless, disturbances in marine microbial communities, caused by pollution or climate change, can result in imbalances that could bring dangerous pathogens to humans, either through direct water exposure or indirectly through food consumption. A 2022 study discovered that neurotoxins present in marine wildlife can have negative effects on environmental and human health. “... BTX exposure has been interrelated with pathways of carbohydrate and energy metabolism, as well as consequent oxidative stress caused by the toxin. These observed metabolic alterations have been integrated into a model consistent with well-characterized neurotoxicity as well as with pathways that may provide aspects including respiratory and pulmonary effects and associated cellular energetics” (Guillotin &amp; Delcourt, 2022).</p><h3><strong>Benefits of Ocean Microbiomes</strong></h3><p class="">Ocean microbiomes have a considerable influence on human health through diverse mechanisms. These tiny creatures in the ocean provide new substances with medical use, resulting in the creation of fresh antibiotics, antivirals, and anti-cancer drugs. Furthermore, the well-being of ocean microbiomes plays a crucial role in the overall health of marine ecosystems, which are essential sources of food for humans, specifically fish and other seafood, a main protein source for millions of people globally. Moreover, comprehending ocean microbiomes improves our understanding of worldwide biogeochemical cycles and environmental changes, helping anticipate and prevent health risks linked to climate change. The health of human populations is closely connected to the well-being of ocean microbiomes, indicating an intricate relationship between the two.</p><h3><strong>Author: Hannah Polson</strong></h3><h4><strong>Works Cited:</strong></h4><p class="">Panthee, Bimala et al. “Environmental and Human Microbiome for Health.” Life (Basel, Switzerland) vol. 12,3 456. 19 Mar. 2022, doi:10.3390/life12030456.</p><p class="">Guillotin, Sophie, and Nicolas Delcourt. “Marine Neurotoxins’ Effects on Environmental and Human Health: An OMICS Overview.” Marine Drugs, vol. 20, no. 1, 2021, pp. 18-, https://doi.org/10.3390/md20010018.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/66477600af20a8583563ac7d/1716777215289-N9JTRUDW3LQ70M7SN2RH/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1500"><media:title type="plain">Marvelous Microbiomes</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Microplastics: Human Fertility &amp; Marine Life</title><dc:creator>Sea Serenity Society</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 02:09:12 +0000</pubDate><link>https://sea-serenity-society.squarespace.com/blog/microplastics-human-fertility-and-marine-life</link><guid isPermaLink="false">66477600af20a8583563ac7d:66477b888458f137de95d488:6653e7976c60441848b3e18e</guid><description><![CDATA[Microplastics are tiny plastic particles that never fully degrade.

Today, microplastics pollute our ocean ecosystems, the air we breathe, and our bodies. These particles threaten the well-being of all species on Earth, including human fertility and marine life.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Science Behind Microplastics &amp; Human Fertility</strong></h3><p class="">Microplastics (or “MPs”) are a significant threat to human fertility. Studies have shown their presence in human placentas, resulting in exposure to fetuses in the womb. Scientists theorize that these microplastics breach the placental barrier, disrupting fetal development and leading to many health complications. Researchers notes in an article titles <em>Microplastics May Be a Significant Cause of Male Infertility,</em> "Numerous studies have demonstrated that maternal exposure to [MPs] has profound influence on offspring at various levels, ranging from weight loss, developmental malformations to immune disturbance, metabolic disorders, circulatory abnormalities, neurological deficits, and reproductive failure" (Zhang et al., 2022).</p><p class="">Indeed, the consumption of microplastics can affect all humans on a cellular level and can damage organ functions, in addition to negatively affecting fertility. One source titled <em>Toxicity of Microplastics and Nanoplastics: Invisible Killers of Female Fertility and Offspring Health</em> notes, “However, direct contact with MP particles can have adverse effects at the cellular level [...]. The ingestion of MPs can cause intestinal damage due to their small size and ability to absorb various toxic substances, heavy metals [...], additives, and chemicals such as phthalate esters [...]. In summary, ingestion of MPs can cause mechanical damage to the intestines, reduce fertility, affect the growth rate of organisms, and have long-term adverse effects on the ecosystem” (Geng et al., 2023).</p><h3><strong>How Do Microplastics Affect Oceans?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p class="">The ocean accounts for over 70% of the Earth’s surface, and has been significantly impacted by pollution, including microplastics. Marine life ingests microplastics through the food chain, both directly and indirectly. These particles build up in the digestive systems of marine animals and cause damage similar to humans in that it can harm sea creatures on a cellular level as well as affect reproductive rates. This abundance of microplastics in our oceans also presents a risk to human health when contaminated seafood is consumed.</p><h3><strong>Microplastics &amp; Coral Reefs</strong></h3><p class="">Microplastics damage coral reefs by blocking the sun’s rays from reaching the coral and by smotherly polyps. Coral reefs are a crucial part of marine ecosystems because they act as habitats for many species and offer protection to coastlines from erosion. Many reefs have already been harmed by the effects of pollution.</p><h3><strong>How Can We Make A Difference?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p class="">We need to take a proactive stance on reducing pollution, including policy changes, public awareness campaigns, and scientific research. Each of us can contribute by reducing our plastic consumption, supporting policies aimed at reducing plastic pollution, and advocating for sustainable alternatives. By taking action now, we can help protect the reproductive health of future generations and preserve the vitality of our oceans.</p><h3><strong>Author: Megan Soules</strong></h3><h4><strong>Works Cited</strong></h4><p class="">Geng, Yuli, et al. “Toxicity of Microplastics and Nanoplastics: Invisible Killers of Female Fertility and Offspring Health.” Frontiers in Physiology, vol. 14, 2023, pp. 1254886–1254886, <span>https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2023.1254886</span>.</p><p class="">Zhang, Chenming, et al. “Microplastics May Be a Significant Cause of Male Infertility.” American Journal of Men’s Health, vol. 16, no. 3, 2022, pp. 15579883221096549–15579883221096549, <span>https://doi.org/10.1177/15579883221096549</span>.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/66477600af20a8583563ac7d/1716775260241-RI4BSRDZJQ84V50H36S4/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1125"><media:title type="plain">Microplastics: Human Fertility &amp; Marine Life</media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
